# Inverted-Pendulum
To control the system, the following was done:
Generated the mathermatical model represented by the diffrential equations descriping the system.
Determined the systems's transfere function.
Bult a model for the system in Simulink.
Invistigated the stability of the system.
Designed PID controller and implemented it in Sumilink.
Tested the controller and analyzed the results to get reduced steady-state error and enhanced transient response.
